      "INFO:applogger:['Cisco Catalyst Center Platform APIs and Integrations Overview. - Cisco Catalyst Center 2.3.7 - Cisco DevNet                          Cisco Catalyst Center Platform APIs and Integrations Overview. This page explains Catalyst Center integration options: Intent APIs provide REST access to the Catalyst Center platform. Integration APIs enable IT Service Management workflows. Events and Notifications WebHooks enables notification on key events. The Multivendor API enables direct support for non-Cisco devi', 'ces. Cisco Catalyst Center Platform Overview Cisco Catalyst Center is at the heart of Cisco’s intent-based network architecture. Catalyst Center supports the expression of business intent for network use cases, such as base automation capabilities in the enterprise network. The Analytics and Assurance features of Catalyst Center provide end-to-end visibility into the network with full context through data and insights. Cisco customers and partners can use the Catalyst Center platform to create value-added a', 'pplications that leverage the native capabilities of Catalyst Center. Use Catalyst Center to enhance the overall network experience by optimizing end-to-end IT processes, reducing Total Cost of Ownership (TCO), and developing new value-added networks with intent APIs, integration flows, and events and notifications.  Cisco DNA Center has been rebranded as Catalyst Center. During the rebranding process, you will see both names used in different collaterals, but both names refer to the same product.  Intent A', 'PI (Northbound) The Intent API is a Northbound REST API that exposes specific capabilities of the Catalyst Center platform. The Intent API provides policy-based abstraction of business intent, allowing focus on an outcome rather than struggling with individual mechanisms steps. The RESTful Catalyst Center Intent API uses HTTPS verbs (GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE) with JSON structures to discover and control the network. For more information, see Intent API. The Intent API is grouped, hierarchically into funct', \"ional 'domains' and 'subdomains' of service.   These are: Authentication Domain The Catalyst Center platform REST methods require caller Authentication.  Authentication method obtains a security token that identifies the privileges of an authenticated REST caller. Catalyst Center authorizes each requested operation according to the access privileges associated with the security token that accompanies the request.  Know Your Network Domain Use the Know Your Network REST methods to GET information about clien\", 'ts, sites, topology, devices, and issues; Create (POST) and manage (PUT, DELETE) sites, devices, IP Pools, edge and border devices, and authentication profiles. Know Your Network methods  are organized into the following subdomains:  Sites   Create and manage sites, assign devices to sites, obtain site information, site count, and site membership.   Sites are hierarchial collections of other sites and buildings.  Topology   Retrieve network health information, and site and network physical, Layer 2, Layer 3', \", and VLAN  information.  Devices   Create, manage, and retrieve detailed information about devices by a wide range of attributes such as timestamp, MAC address, UUID, name, or nwDeviceName,  functional capabilities, interfaces, device config, certificate validation status, values of specified fields,modules, and VLAN data associated with specified interfaces.  Clients   Obtain (GET) detailed client and client health information.  Users   Obtain (GET) detailed information about a 'User' given an identifying\", \"network user-id or MAC address.  Issues   Obtain (GET) detailed information and recommended mitigation for an  'Issue' given an identifying issue-id or MAC address.   Site Management  Site Design   These include methods to create and obtain information about provisioned NFV devices.  Network Settings   Includes methods to GET device credentials, global pool information, and service provider details. It also supports deletion of device credentials, service provider profiles, and global IP pools.  Software I\", 'mage Management (SWIM)   Software Image Management (SWIM) manages the software image and update repository for network devices.   Software images can be stored on the Catalyst Center or imported from a designated URL.   These methods support phases of Software Image Management including the ability to import software images, and distribute and activate images to and on devices.  Device Onboarding (PnP)   This set of methods support management of device onboarding projects, settings, workflows, virtual accou', 'nts, and PnP-managed devices.   They provide means of zero-touch deployment of Cisco Enterprise Network routers, switches and wireless controllers, and wireless access points.  Configuration Templates  Configuration Templates with the Template Programmer/Editor is a centralized CLI-management tool that facilitates design and provisioning of workflows in Catalyst Center.   CLI templates also known as configuration templates.   These methods provide management of CLI templates.   CLI templates may be grouped', 'into projects.   Use this API to create, view, edit, delete and version templates and projects.   Connectivity Connectivity methods provides the means for configuring and managing Fabric Wired and Non-Fabric Wireless networks.  Fabric Wired   These include methods to manage fabric wired devices, including creation, update, and deletion of edge, border, user devices, and authentiation profiles,  Non-Fabric Wireless   These include methods to manage and provision non-fabric wireless devices, including Enterpr', 'ise SSIDs, wireless profiles, RF profiles, and access points.   Operational Tasks Operational Tools enable access to CLI keywords, discover network devices, trace paths through the network, identify and discover network components using SNMP and other discovery protocols,    Command Runner   These methods support retrieval of CLI keywords and enable execution of read-only commands on a target network device.  Network Discovery  Discovery is the process of scanning a target network in order to add existing d', 'evices to the device Inventory.   Discovery service methods using SNMP and other protocols to create, update, delete and manage discovery tasks   and associated credentials.  Path Trace   These methods provide flow-analysis between two endpoints on the network.   New path-traces analysis can be initiated, and prior path-traces can be read.   Multiple prior path traces can be summarized.  File   File services to list file namespaces, files in a namespace, and to download a specific file.  Task  Tasks are Cat', \"alyst Center activities methods initiated for asynchronous execution via an API request.  These GET methods include status information about a single task, indicating completion or if, in-progress.  Task methods also can return a count of tasks, and lists of tasks by 'tree', task-id, OperationId.  Tags  A 'tag' is a named set of attributes that can be associated with 'members'.  Tags services provide the means to create, discover, update membership of, and remove tags.   Policy  Application Policy   The Cat\", \"alyst Center platform enables creation of application policies used to reflect your organization's business intent and translates it into network-specific and device-specific configurations required by the different types, makes, models, operating systems, roles, and resource constraints of your network devices.   Application Policy methods supports the creation, update, adn management of applications and application sets.   Event Management  Event Management   The Catalyst Center platform provides the abil\", 'ity to receive custom notifications when specific events are triggered, such as Cisco Catalyst Assurance and Automation (SWIM) events.   This mechanism enables third party systems to take business actions in response to a particular event.   For example, a custom application could execute a software upgrade action in response to notification of network devices that are out of compliance.   Event subscriptions allow association of a notification method with a Catalyst Center event.   These methods provide th', 'e means to create, read, update, and delete event subscriptions.   Events and Notifications (Eastbound) The Catalyst Center platform provides the ability to establish a notification handler when specific events are triggered, such as Assurance and Automation (SWIM) events. This mechanism enables external systems to take actions in response to an event. For example, a custom application could execute a software upgrade action in response to notification of network devices that are out of compliance. Notifica', 'tions may also be triggered by internal Catalyst Center events.  For example, Assurance events can be customized for IT Service Management incidents. Integration API (Westbound) Integration capabilities are part of Westbound interfaces. To meet the need to scale and accelerate operations in modern data centers, IT operators require intelligent, end-to-end work flows built with open APIs. The Catalyst Center platform provides mechanisms for integrating Assurance workflows and data with third-party IT Service', 'Management (ITSM) solutions. IT Service Management (ITSM) minimizes handoffs, reduces duplication of issues, and optimizes processes by integrating the Catalyst Center platform into incident-management, change-management and problem-management systems. It also integrates the Catalyst Center platform into approval and pre-approval chains, and it links the Catalyst Center platform with formal change and maintenance window schedules. The platform also integrates with Reporting and Analytics capabilities for c', 'apacity planning, asset management, compliance control, and auditing. The Catalyst Center platform boosts IT efficiency and automation by integrating seamlessly with other IT systems through RESTful APIs. The Catalyst Center platform supports the IT4IT™ Reference Architecture, including the standards for events, incidents, problems, and request for changes. If you are using an ITSM system that supports this reference architecture, then the Catalyst Center platform can integrate with your system.']\n",

      "INFO:applogger:['Getting Started - Cisco Catalyst Center 2.3.7 - Cisco DevNet                          Getting started Send REST requests to the Catalyst Center Always-on Sandbox using Postman. Learn how to get an authorization token, troubleshoot errors, and get device inventory. Catalyst Center Environment If you don’t have access to the Catalyst Center environment, we have you covered. The DevNet Sandboxes provide developers with zero-cost, easy access to the Catalyst Center platform to develop and run code agains', 't 24x7. Catalyst Center is available as ALWAYS-ON DevNet Sandboxes for the following deployments:  Catalyst Center AlwaysOn Lab 1 Catalyst Center AlwaysOn Lab 2  Hello World This example uses Postman (a freely available application) to make REST calls against a Catalyst Center appliance. After installing, complete this exercise to send some simple API requests to Catalyst Center.  To use your own Catalyst Center appliance for this tutorial, you must first install the Catalyst Center platform application and', 'then enable the REST API bundle. After enabling the REST API bundle, wait four minutes before attempting to issue a REST request to Catalyst Center.  Installing Postman  Get Postman from the Postman homepage and follow the instructions to install it on your development machine.  Configure Postman to accept self-signed certificates:  Launch Postman.  At the upper-right corner of Postman, click the wrench icon and choose Settings from the drop-down menu.  Figure: Opening Postman Settings    In the Request se', 'ction, set SSL certificate verification to OFF.  Figure: Allowing self-signed certificates in Postman    Dismiss the Settings window by clicking X in the upper-right corner of the window.     Generating an Authorization Token Catalyst Center accepts REST requests from authenticated users only. To authenticate to Catalyst Center, you must submit your user credentials. Successful authentication returns an authorization token that you can use to issue subsequent requests. To generate an authorization token, ta', \"ke the following steps:  Launch Postman if you have not done so already.  Create a new request.   Make sure the Create New tab is selected in Postman's opening screen. Click the Request button in the Building Blocks section.  Postman shows the Create dialog box. Give your new request a name and description, then save it to a new or existing collection.  Set the request type to POST.  For new requests, Postman sets the default request type to GET. You need to change this setting to POST for this particular r\", 'equest.  Supply the REST request URL.  Enter the request URL in the text field next to the request-type menu, replacing IP-address with the IP address of your Catalyst Center instance. For example, to use the DevNet Always-On Sandbox, replace IP-address with the sandboxdnac.cisco.com domain name.  In Catalyst Center version 1.2.6 and above, the URL must be of the following form: https://<IP ADDRESS>/dna/system/api/v1/auth/token For older versions of Catalyst Center, the URL must be of the following form: ht', 'tps://<IP ADDRESS>/api/system/v1/auth/token   To find your Catalyst Center version number, choose About Catalyst Center from the \"gear\" menu  on any page of the Catalyst Center user interface.   Choose Basic Auth.   In the Authorization tab below the URL field, pull down the Type menu and select Basic Auth. Postman displays a login form.   In the login form, enter a valid username and password for your Catalyst Center instance.  For the DevNet Always-On Sandbox, use the following credentials:   Username: de', 'vnetuser Password: Cisco123!   Send the request. Click Send. Postman sends the request to the Catalyst Center instance and displays the response. If your login is successful, Catalyst Center returns a 200 OK response and a JSON response body that looks like the following example: {   \"Token\": \"eyJ0eXA ... O5uEMR-tc\" }   This JSON body contains a single JSON object that defines a key-value pair. A colon (:) separates the \"Token\" key from its associated value. This value is the authorization token itself. Bot', 'h the key and the value are surrounded by double-quotation (\") marks.  To improve readability, this listing omits part of the value. The token that Catalyst Center returns is much longer than this example listing.   Troubleshooting  If you received a status code other than 200 OK, check the following and then retry your request:  Recheck the URL that you supplied. Make sure that you specified POST as the action. Make sure you turned off SSL Verification in Postman; see Installing Postman. If you are using y', 'our own Catalyst Center appliance or a reservation-based DevNet Sandbox, you may encounter bug CSCvn64908. To work around this problem, disable the REST API bundle, re-enable it, then wait four minutes before issuing a REST call. See Enabling the Catalyst Center REST API Bundle in Reserved Sandboxes.    Device Inventory Example To use the authorization token in a request for a device inventory, take the following steps:  Create a request.   To create this request, you can use a procedure similar to the one', 'that you used in the previous section. Add the following data to the request:  Set the request type to GET.  Enter the REST request URL  In Catalyst Center version 1.2.6 and above, the URL is of the following form: https://<IP ADDRESS>/dna/intent/api/v1/network-device In older versions of Catalyst Center, the URL is of the following form: https://<IP ADDRESS>/api/v1/network-device  Replace IP_address with the IP address of your Catalyst Center instance. For example, to use the DevNet Always-On Sandbox, repl', 'ace IP-address with the sandboxdnac.cisco.com domain name.    Add an X-Auth-Token header to your request. This header provides the authorization token that you generated in the previous section of this exercise.    Click Headers. In the key field, type X-Auth-Token. In the value field, paste the value of the \"Token\" JSON object that your token-generation request returned. Do not include the quotation marks.   Send the request.     Click Send. Postman sends the request to the   Catalyst Center instance and d', 'isplays its response.   A successful request results in a response that contains a JSON   object containing the key \"response\". The value of \"response\" is an   array of objects, each of which describes a device in the Catalyst Center   inventory.  NOTE: If you query a Catalyst Center instance that has not yet discovered any network devices, the result contains no devices. To see a fully populated result, issue this request to the Catalyst Center instance in the DevNet Always-On Sandbox. For more information', 'about device discovery, see \"Discover Your Network\" in the Catalyst Center User Guide.  Here\\'s an example response, from the Catalyst Center instance in the DevNet Always-On Sandbox:     {       \"response\": [         {           \"type\": \"Cisco ASR 1001-X Router\",

      "INFO:applogger:['API Quick Start - Cisco Catalyst Center 2.3.7 - Cisco DevNet                          API Quickstart The goal of the Cisco Catalyst Center platform is to deliver world-class integration capabilities and a development environment that will drive greater partner innovations, provide seamless integration with the partner eco-system, and result in greater customer satisfaction. Catalyst Center Platform API Overview To view Catalyst Center API documentation through the Developer Toolkit in the Platform Po', 'rtal (Figure 2). To view APIs, click Platform > Developer Toolkit.  If the Platform tab is not available, a user with super-admin permissions must install the Cisco Catalyst Center Platform application on your Catalyst Center instance. For more information, see \"Deploy Catalyst Center Platform\" in the Cisco Catalyst Center Platform User Guide for your release version.  Figure: Developer Toolkit on the Catalyst Center Platform tab  The Developer Toolkit provides documentation about each API call, organized a', 'ccording to functional areas of the Intent API. Figure: Catalyst Center APIs in the Developer Toolkit   If the Developer Toolkit is not available, a user with super-admin permissions must install and enable the  Catalyst Center REST API bundle on your Catalyst Center instance. For more information, see \"Configure Bundles\" in the Cisco Catalyst Center Platform User Guide for your release version.  Click a request name to get detailed information, including the request method and URL, query parameters, reques', 't header parameters, responses, and schema, along with ways to preview or test the request.  Prerequisites In order to run the code examples featured here, you must have Python 3.6 with the requests library installed. Use pip to install the requests library as shown below: pip install requests You must also import HTTPBasicAuth from requests.auth. Authentication The Catalyst Center APIs use token-based authentication. Run the following Python script to log in: def get_token():     token = requests.post(', \"‘https://<cluster IP>/dna/system/api/v1/auth/token’,        auth=HTTPBasicAuth(            username=<username>,            password=<password>        ),        headers={'content-type': 'application/json'},        verify=False,     )     data = token.json()     return data[‘Token’]  Responses and Error Codes Responses The Catalyst Center APIs use a task-based response architecture so that multiple requests and responses can be sent concurrently. Therefore, all PUT, POST, and DELETE requests have a task-b\", 'ased response (pictured below). To view more details about the response, send a GET request to the task URL (either from a script or as a URL). API responses for GET requests are in JSON format, as shown in the examples that follow. Error Codes The error codes for Catalyst Center APIs follow the standard HTTP status codes. Occasionally error codes will contain more specific information about the request. For example, the request has the following response when the input request is not valid: {     ‘response', '’: {         ‘errorCode’: ‘Bad request’,         ‘message’: ‘Invalid input request’,         ‘detail’: ‘There was an error processing the input arguments.’     },     ‘version’: ‘1.0’ }  Examples View Details About a Specific Network Device in Catalyst Center In the Device Inventory in Catalyst Center you can view information about the devices in Catalyst Center. In the figure below, you can see that there is a wireless controller with the management IP address 10.93.141.38.  To get more information about t', 'his WLC in a JSON format, run the following script: def get_device_from_dnac(device_ip):     response = requests.get(         ‘https://<cluster ip>/dna/intent/api/v1/network-device/ip-address/{}’.format(device_ip),         headers={             ‘X-Auth-Token’: ‘{}’.format(token),             ‘Content-type’: ‘application/json’,         },         verify=False     )     return response.json()  A sample response looks like this: {     \"response\": [         {             \"family\": \"Wireless Controller\",', '\"lastUpdateTime\": 1668796235340,             \"macAddress\": \"00:0c:29:7f:8b:5d\",             \"deviceSupportLevel\": \"Supported\",             \"softwareType\": \"IOS-XE\",             \"softwareVersion\": \"17.4.1\",             \"serialNumber\": \"9L2L5LZBF76\",             \"inventoryStatusDetail\": \"<status><general code=\\\\\"SUCCESS\\\\\"/></status>\",             \"collectionInterval\": \"Global Default\",             \"managementState\": \"Managed\",             \"upTime\": \"127 days, 21:14:25.02\",             \"lastUpdated\": \"2022', '-11-18 18:30:35\",             \"roleSource\": \"AUTO\",             \"apManagerInterfaceIp\": \"\",             \"bootDateTime\": \"2022-07-13 21:16:35\",             \"collectionStatus\": \"Managed\",             \"hostname\": \"C9800-CL\",             \"locationName\": null,             \"managementIpAddress\": \"10.93.141.38\",             \"platformId\": \"C9800-CL-K9\",             \"reachabilityFailureReason\": \"\",             \"reachabilityStatus\": \"Reachable\",             \"series\": \"Cisco Catalyst 9800 Wireless Controllers for Clou', 'd\",             \"snmpContact\": \"\",             \"snmpLocation\": \"\",             \"associatedWlcIp\": \"\",             \"apEthernetMacAddress\": null,             \"errorCode\": null,             \"errorDescription\": null,             \"interfaceCount\": \"0\",             \"lineCardCount\": \"0\",             \"lineCardId\": \"\",             \"managedAtleastOnce\": true,             \"memorySize\": \"NA\",             \"tagCount\": \"0\",             \"tunnelUdpPort\": null,             \"uptimeSeconds\": 11049529,             \"waasDeviceMo', 'de\": null,             \"type\": \"Cisco Catalyst 9800-CL Wireless Controller for Cloud\",             \"description\": \"Cisco IOS Software [Bengaluru], C9800-CL Software (C9800-CL-K9_IOSXE), Version 17.4.1, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc5) Technical Support: http://www.cisco.com/techsupport Copyright (c) 1986-2020 by Cisco Systems, Inc.

      "INFO:applogger:['Asynchronous APIs - Cisco Catalyst Center 2.3.7 - Cisco DevNet                          Asynchronous operations When the Catalyst Center platform returns a 202 (Accepted) HTTP status code, the result body includes a task ID and a URL that you can use to query for more information about the asynchronous task that your original request spawned. For example, you can use this information to determine whether a lengthy task has completed. Continuing the previous example, if your POST /discovery request di', 'd not fail immediately, Catalyst Center returned a response similar to the following:     \"response\": {         \"taskId\": \"85c95140-50fc-4a57-994d-db58d3afe6b3\",         \"url\": \"dna/intent/api/v1/task/85c95140-50fc-4a57-994d-db58d3afe6b3\"     },     \"version\": \"1.0\"     }  The taskID value identifies this task uniquely system-wide.

In some cases, a human-readable progress value may provide further information: {   \"response\": {     \"startTime\": 1524880285900,     \"endTime\": 1524880286849,     \"version\": 1524880286621,     \"serviceType\": \"Discovery Service\",     \"isError\": fals', 'e,     \"lastUpdate\": 1524880286621,     \"progress\": \"1\",     \"rootId\": \"9dee6883-4028-4879-b4d6-44c86849429b\",     \"instanceTenantId\": \"5ae2347239dfc600df3bb7eb\",     \"id\": \"9dee6883-4028-4879-b4d6-44c86849429b\"   },   \"version\": \"1.0\" }  Note: Using the url parameter returns the same information that issuing your own GET /task/taskID request does. The url parameter is a convenience: it simply provides a ready-made URL that you can use to issue the GET /task/taskID request. Some environments, like Postman,', 'present this parameter as a clickable item that issues the request. If you choose to use this feature, remember to add a valid X-Auth-Token header to the new request. It is important to understand that 202 Accepted does not necessarily imply success of the task that the request created. For example, if you post a discovery that has the same name as an existing discovery, your POST /discovery request is accepted but the discovery task fails. To see this for yourself, issue your previous discovery request aga', 'in, without making any changes. As before, you\\'ll get a 202 Accepted response from the Catalyst Center platform, but when you use the GET /task API to investigate the status of the discovery task, you will find that it has failed. {   \"response\": {     \"startTime\": 1524880671753,     \"endTime\": 1524880671799,     \"version\": 1524880671790,     \"errorCode\": \"Discovery name is duplicate\",     \"serviceType\": \"Discovery Service\",     \"isError\": true,     \"lastUpdate\": 1524880671790,     \"progress\": \"Failed to cr', 'eate discovery\",     \"rootId\": \"a8805e89-b400-40a2-b6a2-49a9d8330629\",     \"failureReason\": \"Discovery name is duplicate\",     \"instanceTenantId\": \"5ae2347239dfc600df3bb7eb\",     \"id\": \"a8805e89-b400-40a2-b6a2-49a9d8330629\"   },   \"version\": \"1.0\" }  However, you can use the Intent API to restart or stop an existing discovery; it just requires a different approach than creating a new discovery.

      "INFO:applogger:['Authentication and Authorization - Cisco Catalyst Center 2.3.7 - Cisco DevNet                          Authentication and Authorization guide Introduction Cisco Catalyst Center has a REST API that an authenticated and authorized user can leverage to do operations over an HTTPS connection. When the user autenticates, it receives a token that it needs to send in the following requests in order to be authorized to execute calls to the API. Goal The goal of this guide is create a script that authenticate', 's against the Catalyst Center API and obtains the authorization token needed to make requests to the API.  Endpoints and methods used  POST /dna/system/api/v1/auth/token  Prerequisites For this module, it is recommended that the user has general python and REST APIs knowledge. The following links can help you get up to speed if needed:  Programming Fundamentals REST API Fundamentals  Environment This guide was developed using:  Cisco Catalyst Center 2.3.5.x. Python 3.7.x  Authentication API The Authenticati', 'on endpoint used in this guide is /dna/system/api/v1/auth/token, which is valid for version 1.2.6 and above. The HTTP method used for the endpoint is POST and it requires for the user to send its credentials using Basic Authentication. Note: For systems with versions below that, the endpoint is /api/system/v1/auth/token Basic Authentication Authentication is done by using the Basic authentication scheme, as defined in RFC 7617. The format of the credentials is USERNAME:PASSWORD and it needs to be base64 enc', 'oded. Then, the encoded string is sent as part of the Authorization header over clear text, hence doing it over a HTTPS/TLS connection is highly recommended. AES Key Encryption Catalyst Center support is extended for AES key encryption for token APIs, which is an optional feature that computes and formats the authorization header of token APIs in a base 64 encoded string of 256-bit AES key. The format of the string is CSCO-AES-256 credentials=Base64Encode(AESEncrypt(username:password , aes256 key)).  The AE', 'SEncrypt first encrypts the username:password pair with a 256 bits AES key and then Base64Encode encodes the result in base 64 string format. Authorization is done by AES256 scheme, as defined in RFC 2617. Note:   You can enable the AES key encryption from the Catalyst Center system configuration. If you disable the AES key encryption from the Catalyst Center system configuration, the default basic authentication is enabled by default.  Token Once the user authenticates, it receives a token from the API end', 'point, which needs to be included in every request as part of the X-Auth-Token header. Authentication code We will create a python script that authenticates and prints the token that is needed for authentication. We will use the python requests library, importing both the requests library but also the HTTPBasicAuth specifically, which simplifies the Basic Authentication process. import requests from requests.auth import HTTPBasicAuth  Next, we will import the urllib3 library and call the disable_warnings()', 'function. This is NOT recommended on a production environment. We use it here in the development environment to avoid the warning that we would get of using a self-signed certificate in Catalyst Center. import urllib3 urllib3.disable_warnings()  Next, we define four general variables of the script:  Base URL: IP Address or Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) of the Catalyst Center server Auth URL: API endpoint used for authentication Username: Catalyst Center USERNAME Password: Catalyst Center PASSWORD  BASE', \"_URL = 'https://10.10.10.181' AUTH_URL = '/dna/system/api/v1/auth/token' USERNAME = '<USERNAME>' PASSWORD = '<PASSWORD>'  Finally, the request is done using POST, which returns a json body with the token. The verify=False parameter is used in order to query a server with a self-signed certificate. On a production environment, with a valid certificate generated by a trusted certificate authority, it is not needed. response = requests.post(baseUrl + authUrl, auth=HTTPBasicAuth(USERNAME, PASSWORD), verify=Fals\", \"e) print(response.json()['Token'])  Code The repository for this guide is here.

Use the task ID to query the Task API for a result, if su', \"ccessful obtain the file ID of the result. Retrieve the file contents from the file API.

Device credentials are those associate with a site. There are several types of credentials:  CLI NETCONF SNMP (2/3) HTTP  Each of those types of credentials has its own endpoint because of the d\", \"ifferent options supported by each type of credentials. Credentials are async APIs, so you need to query the task API if you want to query the result of a credentials operation. Batch creation of credentials is supported as the API expects an array of credentials, which can have a single credential but also many others.

In this guide we will create a template with two variables. We will create a template and after that, we will retrieve the templateId in order to commit it, which\", 'makes it possible to use it to deploy to devices. template_info = {     \"name\": \"DNA Center Guide\",     \"description\": \"Guide Configuration Template\",     \"tags\": [],     \"deviceTypes\": [         {             \"productFamily\": \"Routers\",             \"productSeries\": \"Cisco 1000 Series Integrated Services Routers\"         }     ],     \"softwareType\": \"IOS-XE\",     \"softwareVariant\": \"XE\",     \"templateContent\": \"ip access-list extended $permitACLName\\\\npermit ip 10.0.0.0 0.255.255.25.0 any\\\\npermit ip 172.16.', '0.0 0.15.255.255 any\\\\npermit ip 192.168.0.0 0.0.255.255 any\\\\n!\\\\n\\\\nip access-list extended $denyACLName\\\\ndeny ip 10.0.0.0 0.255.255.25.0 any\\\\ndeny ip 172.16.0.0 0.15.255.255 any\\\\ndeny ip 192.168.0.0 0.0.255.255 any\\\\n!\\\\n\",     \"rollbackTemplateContent\": \"\",     \"templateParams\": [         {             \"parameterName\": \"permitACLName\",             \"dataType\": \"STRING\",             \"defaultValue\": None,             \"description\": None,             \"required\": True,             \"notParam\": False,             \"p', 'aramArray\": False,             \"displayName\": None,             \"instructionText\": None,             \"group\": None,             \"order\": 1,             \"selection\": {                 \"selectionType\": None,                 \"selectionValues\": {},                 \"defaultSelectedValues\": []             },             \"range\": [],             \"key\": None,             \"provider\": None,             \"binding\": \"\"         },         {             \"parameterName\": \"denyACLName\",             \"dataType\": \"STRING\",', '\"defaultValue\": None,             \"description\": None,             \"required\": True,             \"notParam\": False,             \"paramArray\": False,             \"displayName\": None,             \"instructionText\": None,             \"group\": None,             \"order\": 2,             \"selection\": {                 \"selectionType\": None,                 \"selectionValues\": {},                 \"defaultSelectedValues\": []             },             \"range\": [],             \"key\": None,             \"provid', 'er\": None,             \"binding\": \"\"         }     ],     \"rollbackTemplateParams\": [],     \"composite\": False,     \"containingTemplates\": [] }  TEMPLATE_URL = \\'/dna/intent/api/v1/template-programmer/project/{project_id}/template\\' response = requests.post(BASE_URL + TEMPLATE_URL.format(project_id=project_id),                          headers=headers, json=template,                          verify=False)  task_id = response.json()[\\'response\\'][\\'taskId\\']  time.sleep(3) TASK_BY_ID_URL = \\'/dna/intent/api/v1/task', '/{task_id}\\' response = requests.get(BASE_URL + TASK_BY_ID_URL.format(task_id=task_id),                         headers=headers, verify=False)  template_id = response.json()[\\'response\\'][\\'data\\']  After the template creation, it is needed to commit it in order to have a version suitable for deployment to a device. template_version = {     \"comments\": \"DNAC Guide Initial Version\",     \"templateId\": template_id } TEMPLATE_VERSION_URL = \\'/dna/intent/api/v1/template-programmer/template/version\\' response = requests', '.post(BASE_URL + TEMPLATE_VERSION_URL,                          headers=headers, json=template_version,                          verify=False)  Template deployment Once the template is created and committed, it is available for deployment to a device, which can also be done using the Template API.

The API allows you to query that information to use it for inventory, more operations within Catalyst Center or as a source of truth of your network. Goal The goals of this guide are:  Get the sum of devices known by Catalyst Center Platform Get the list of devices Filter the list of devices by platform ID Filter the list', 'of devices by hostname Get the information of a single device   Endpoints and methods used  POST /dna/system/api/v1/auth/token GET /dna/intent/api/v1/network-device/count GET /dna/intent/api/v1/network-device GET /dna/intent/api/v1/network-device/<device_id>  Prerequisites For this module, it is recommended that the user already has experience authenticating with Catalyst Center:  Authentication and Authorization  Environment This guide was developed using:  Cisco Catalyst Center 2.3.5.x. Python 3.7.x  Aut', \"hentication First, we need to authenticate and retrieve a token from the API.  Do not use verify=False or urllib3.disable_warnings() if you are not sure of its purpose.

Devices Count Once the developer has the token, it is possible to get the network devices count.

Leveraging Discovery API, the user can quickly get its devices into Catalyst Center and perform operations related to them.

It is a powerful set of APIs that the user can use to create and manage border, edge and control plane devices, assign ports for user devices and access points and deploy a SDA fabric. Goal The goals of this guide are:  Create a SDA fabric Assign a site to the S', 'DA Fabric Create an authentication profile Create a virtual network Add an IP pool to the virtual network Define a device as a control plane device Define a device as an edge device Define a device as a border device Assign a port as a user device port Assign a port as an access point port   Endpoints and methods used  POST /dna/system/api/v1/auth/token POST /dna/intent/api/v1/business/sda/fabric POST /dna/intent/api/v1/business/sda/fabric-site POST /dna/intent/api/v1/business/sda/authentication-profile POS', 'T /dna/intent/api/v1/business/sda/virtual-network POST /dna/intent/api/v1/business/sda/virtualnetwork/ippool POST /dna/intent/api/v1/business/sda/control-plane-device POST /dna/intent/api/v1/business/sda/border-device POST /dna/intent/api/v1/business/sda/edge-device POST /dna/intent/api/v1/business/sda/hostonboarding/user-device POST /dna/intent/api/v1/business/sda/hostonboarding/access-point  Prerequisites For this guide, it is recommended that the developer is familiar with authenticating to Catalyst Cent', 'er API, managing sites, devices and global IP pools.  Authentication and Authorization Devices Sites Global IP pools  Environment This guide was developed using:  Catalyst Center 2.3.5.x Python 3.7.x  Authentication First, we need to authenticate and retrieve a token from the API.  Do not use verify=False or urllib3.disable_warnings() if you are not sure of its purpose.

Read Authentication and Authorization.  import requests from requests.auth import HTTPBasicAuth import urllib3 urllib3.disable_warnings()  BASE_URL = 'https://<IP Address>' AUTH_URL = '/dna/system/api/v1/auth/token' USERNAME = '<USERNAME>' PASSWORD = '<PASSWORD>'  response =\", \"requests.post(BASE_URL + AUTH_URL, auth=HTTPBasicAuth(USERNAME, PASSWORD), verify=False) token = response.json()['Token'] headers = {'X-Auth-Token': token, 'Content-Type': 'application/json'}  Site API The Site API is composed of eight APIs. Site API allows the user to create a logical hierarchy of area, building and floor, assign devices to that hierarchy, get the list of devices in a hierarchy and get the health information of the site. Site Creation API During this guide we will create a Catalyst Center\", 'Guide area and a Catalyst Center Guide Building under the area.
